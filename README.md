# What it does?
This program extract all unique words from a source document while filtering out common words, slang, or any other unwanted terms specified in exclusion files. Steps:  
• Extracting Unique Words  
• Exclusion Filtering from the given files(case-insensitive)
## Usage
**This program uses C99 standard.**  
Compile using
```c
make
```
Then run and use
```bash
./vocab_processor source_file exclusion_file_1 exclusion_file_2 ... > Output
```
**Note that you can easily change the minimum word length or hash table size by editing constants in the source code.**

## What is the point?
Imagine you want to learn words of a video, book, etc. All, even the highest level of texts, has many simple words that you may already know, but by filtering them out, you have a fresh list of hard words you may didn't even saw. So in short, this program paves the way to learn new words fast.
