```
## Features
• Extracting Unique Words  
• Exclusion Filtering from the given files  
• Case-Insensitive

**Note that you can easily change the minimum word length or hash table size by editing constants in the source code.**

## What is the point?
Imagine you want to learn words of a video, book, etc. All, even the highest level of texts, has many simple words that you may already know, but by filtering them out, you have a fresh list of hard words you may didn't even saw. So in short, this program paves the way to learn new words fast.

**This code is generated by AI, therefore, I cannot maintain it (at least now.)**
